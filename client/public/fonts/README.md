# Font Integration Instructions

## Rigot Bold Font Setup

To use the custom Rigot Bold font for the "aakaara" brand name, please follow these steps:

### Upload your Rigot Bold font files here:
- Place your `rigot-bold.woff2`, `rigot-bold.woff`, or `rigot-bold.ttf` files in this directory
- The application will automatically use them for the aakaara brand name

### Current status:
The application is set up to use Rigot Bold for the brand name and Quicksand for all other text. 
If Rigot Bold files are not found, it will fall back to Quicksand and system fonts.
